# Cooking Game (GameMaker - Game Design I Group Project)

## Description 
This is the first game I created in a group project for Jacksonville State University's Game Design project. I conceptualized the game and was put in charge of creating the code. The sprites were all created by a fellow group member as well as the sound effects and game music. We met every Monday, Tuesday and Friday for 3 weeks to create this game, as well as devoted off-campus hours to completing the project. 

The Game was presented at the end of the project and was awarded best in class. 

### Features
